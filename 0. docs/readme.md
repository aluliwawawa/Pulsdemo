For practice and demostration

This repo holds the **data models, SQL logic, and documentation**, while Data lives in Snowflake, sample queries embeded in relevant worksheets.

## üìÅ Demo_Sectors and Layers

Built separately for following sectors: 1.operational controlling, 2.ProductLifeCycle, 3.Sales controlling. While first 2 sectors are for practice, the demostration focuses on the last sector, Sales.

### 1 Design
Data warehouse modeling, Data Architecture design, Star/Galaxy Schema, setup Modeling.md, Dictionary, and ER-Diagram 
**Reverse Modeling: in Demo phase, the outlook of final output is firstly designed, to decide reversely what 'raw' data need to be prepared**

### 2 Raw
Simulate raw data pipelines, create raw tables, insert Dummy (dirty) data based on business simulation

### 3 Stage
Simulate Data cleaning (DataType, Deduplication, Validation, normalize semi-structured data), create stage tables, dimension tables

### 4 Mart
Simulate Business-oriented data modeling, aggregated dataset for reporting, analytics and performance monitoring

### 5 View
Build DA View for PowerBI, Connect with PowerBI Dashboard
**Due to tech issue is the connection between Snowflake and PowerBI Desktop unstable, so CSV format is used as intermedia for I/O**

## üìÅ Files Overview

Each layer contains structured documentation and SQL logic:  

| File            | Purpose                                                                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `readme.md`     |  Describes this layer‚Äôs purpose, logic, and roles.                                   |
| `modeling.md`   |  Explains transformation logic or modeling design    |
| `dictionary.md` |  Data dictionary for key fields, source mappings, and KPI definitions.                 |
| `*.sql`         |  Backup of SnowSQL scripts                      |


**Note:**
`dictionary.md` is only used in RAW and MART, where field definitions and business KPIs are critical.
